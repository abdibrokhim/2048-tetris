# 2048-tetris

**Version**: 0.1.1

A version of Tetris that includes some ideas from the game 2048.

This is just a proof of concept, put together very quickly. It has not been extensively tested, and the core features could have significant flaws.

To play the game, download the `2048-tetris.html` and file and run it in your browser.

Here is a screenshot of a quick play-through:

To work on down the road:

 - Rewrite code from scratch
 - Add missing Tetris features such as holding and being able to see what's coming next
 - Improve user interface
 - Perfect how the 2048 mechanics work and come up with unique ideas
